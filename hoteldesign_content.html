            Artist Nicolas Garrison re-imagined the Milano Hotel with its distinct Renaissance-revival style in 2006. He was inspired by the aesthetics, vibrant colors and artistry of that era, clearly shown in the lush, undiluted color palette he chose for every wall, curtain and carpet in the Hotel. His juxtaposition of materials and furnishings is as playful as his work with colors â€” brickwork is juxtaposed against untreated wood beams made of Douglas fir and walnut, and Baroque Louis XV chairs sit below a changing collection of hand-selected masterpieces of modern art.

            The Milano Hotel's creative flair can be found in each of its 190 Guest Rooms and Suites, which offer a unique composition of colors, textures and a rare collection of art, photographs and objects. Though every room is one of a kind, each shares a common opulent ambience. With hand-stitched, leather-topped desks, 400-thread-count Italian linens, deep red velvet curtains, mahogany English Drinking Cabinets, marble vanities and luxurious beauty products, the Rooms and Suites are a lavish sanctuary for guests.
