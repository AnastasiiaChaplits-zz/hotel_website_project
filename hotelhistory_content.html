                    The legendary Milano Park Hotel has always been, and still is, the place to be for actors, artists, writers, intellectuals and fashion designers. With a prime location adjacent to the Manhattan's only Private Park, Gramercy Park, this landmark Hotel has been a home to creative minds from around the world for nearly a century.

                    The origins of the 18-story Renaissance Revival Hotel can be traced to one of 66 swampy lots parceled out in the 1830s to draw potential residents "uptown." ( Park gets its name from the Dutch krom moerasje, which Eventually morphed into "Gramercy" and means "crooked little swamp"). But what was formerly a marshy expanse of land gave way to rows of charming townhouses, the neighborhood's namesake park, major arteries like Lexington Avenue, and of course, the Milano Park Hotel.

                    The stately Milano Hotel, designed by Robert T. Lyons and constructed by famous developer brothers Bing and Bing, was built on the site where Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Edith Wharton was born and where flamboyant architect Stanford White had lived.

In the sixties, the Rolling Stones resided there after their first American tour, and Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Clash and Bob Marley were all known to spend time in the NYC Hotel. In the seventies, Blondie's Debbie Harry and Christ Stein lived in room 501. And in the eighties, then up-and-comers U2 were long-term Guests.

                    For 8 decades, the Milano Hotel remained much the same until art collector and real estate developer Aby Rosen took it over. In 2006, he enlisted artist and Oscar-nominated film director Julian Schnabel and British architect John Pawson to renovate the space in a way that would maintain the NY Hotel's unique history while giving it bold, modern flourishes. The renovation was extensive - the entire second floor of the lobby was ripped out to make way for 20-foot ceilings, and Schnabel designed or curated many of the furnishings, paintings and sculptures that fill the space today.
