            The Milano Park Hotel is located in a quiet, tree-line neighborhood alive with legend and history. Astors, Morgans, Rockefellers and Roosevelts all lived here, and their elegant townhouses are still part of the neighborhood’s unique charm.
            One of the country's earliest examples of city planning, the Gramercy Park neighborhood was created in the 1830s with a garden surrounded by stately townhouses at the foot of Lexington Avenue. The charming area, which is just steps away from Manhattan’s most bustling shopping districts, showcases more than a century's worth of handsome residential architecture

            A short list of past and present residents includes John Barrymore, Oscar Wilde, James Cagney, John Steinbeck, Thomas Edison, Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Jimmy Fallon and Rufus Wainwright.

            The Hotel offers access to the lush Gramercy Park, Milano`s only Private Park and a quiet refuge for those who step inside its gates. This tranquil, tree-lined oasis is the perfect place to find peace and quiet, read the paper or reflect on the neighborhood's rich history. Here, Cyrus Field conceived the Trans-Atlantic Cable, Mark Twain played pool, and an 8-year-old John F. Kennedy chased the squirrels.
